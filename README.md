Project Odin- JavaScript/jQuery Project.

In this project, you'll get a chance to actually build a pretty nifty tool to flex your Javascript and jQuery muscles. Up until now, you've had your hand held quite a bit by Codecademy. Now it's time to do it on your own. You're going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
